<h2>Working Hours</h2>
<p>
  I work term time from 7.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Thursday. Subject to availability, I offer full day sessions (10 hours) or morning sessions 7.30am to 12.30pm (5 hours) and afternoon sessions 12.30pm to 5.30pm (5 hours). You can drop off and pick up your child at any agreed time during these hours, but please note that I charge for the whole session regardless of the actual hours used.
